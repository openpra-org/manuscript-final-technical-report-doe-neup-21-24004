% \subsection{Coherent vs. Noncoherent Fault Trees}
% \acrshort{ft}s are usually \emph{coherent}, meaning if a certain set of basic events causes a failure, then having more basic events fail cannot fix that failure--no NOT gates or other negations exist to undo the top event. However, some advanced \acrshort{ft}s allow thresholds or special conditions that introduce partial noncoherence (e.g., a system that can fail only if a valve is stuck \emph{open} and a pump is \emph{working} to overpressurize a vessel). Such cases add complexity and require extended gates or additional modeling logic.
