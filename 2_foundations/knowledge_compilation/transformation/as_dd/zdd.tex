\subsubsection{Zero-Suppressed Decision Diagrams (ZDD)}
\label{sec:zdd}

For certain applications, notably combinatorial itemset enumeration and other \emph{sparse} set representations, \acrfull{zdd} can be more compact than standard \acrshort{bdd}s. Although \acrshort{zdd}s adhere to similar principles of node-based variable testing, they selectively \emph{omit} many zero-branches that do not yield new information.

\paragraph{Key Distinctions.}
While \acrshort{zdd}s also enforce an ordering and can be reduced via isomorphism checks, the core difference lies in the zero-suppression mechanism:
\begin{itemize}
\item If following a 0-edge provides no meaningful distinction in the final outcome, that 0-edge and its corresponding node are pruned.
\item The 1-branches are retained but merged where possible, much as in \acrshort{robdd}s.
\end{itemize}
By removing portions of the diagram where “nothing interesting” (i.e.\ no new sets or subsets) occurs, the diagram remains compact.

\paragraph{Illustrative Example}
Revisiting $f(a,b,c)=a \land \bigl(b \lor c\bigr)$ from above, Figure~\ref{fig:zdd} sketches a plausible \acrshort{zdd}. Note here:
\begin{itemize}
\item Node (a) splits into a 0-edge that immediately goes to a node (or directly to a \texttt{0}-terminal) that is pruned if it carries no unique set representation.
\item The 1-edge leads to further variable tests ($b$ or $c$), but many 0-branches are again suppressed if they do not alter the final outcome distinct from an already-represented path.
\end{itemize}

In general, \acrshort{zdd}s apply much the same merging rules as \acrshort{robdd}s and can yield similarly unique structures for a given variable order. They tend to excel in representing large but sparsely populated families of subsets (e.g., all minimal cut sets in a reliability system) because superfluous 0-edges are systematically suppressed.
