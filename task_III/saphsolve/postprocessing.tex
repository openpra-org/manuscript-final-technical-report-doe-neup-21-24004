\section{SAPHSOLVE Post-Processing Engine Development}
\label{sec:saphsolve-devel}

Accident sequence \acrshort{mcs} generated during \acrshort{pra} often require manipulation to address specific modeling concerns, such as post-accident scenarios, \acrshort{ccf} modeling, and the elimination of mutually exclusive events. Rather than re-quantifying the entire model for each manipulation---a process that can be computationally expensive---the post-processing engine in \acrshort{saphire} allows users to manipulate generated \acrshort{mcs} by defining rules.

The initial implementation of \acrshort{mcs} manipulation in \acrshort{saphire} dates back to 1996 and was known as the recovery engine \cite{Smith1996SAPHIRE}. To utilize the post-processing engine, users create a \emph{Rule File} through the \acrshort{gui}. This file consists of a series of \texttt{if}-\texttt{else} statements that specify the events or conditions under which certain actions are performed. Depending on the conditions defined by the user in the Rule File, the \acrshort{saphire} post-processing engine updates the generated \acrshort{mcs} and their associated failure probabilities for each accident sequence.

Although the current post-processing engine integrates seamlessly with other engines in the \acrshort{saphire} \acrshort{api} and functions effectively, the \acrshort{saphire} team prioritizes maintainability. Given the rapid evolution of computational resources, programming languages, and software environments, the team commits to adopting newer technologies to ensure long-term functionality of \acrshort{saphire}, its \acrfull{spar} models, and related components. For a more comprehensive description of Rule Files, including keywords and examples, see the \acrshort{saphire} Manual Volume~3 \cite{saphire_manual}.

\subsection{Core Functions of the New Post-Processing Engine}
\label{sec:core-functions}

The new post-processing engine has been completely re-built from the ground up and comprises five core functions. Figure~\ref{fig:postproc-engine-schematic} provides a simple schematic of how the post-processing engine interacts with input files, rules, and the resulting updated output. Table~\ref{tab:coreFunctions} summarizes the five core components of the new post-processing engine and their primary roles.

\input{task_III/saphsolve/tables/coreFunctions}

The \acrshort{jscutin} file and the rule file are used as inputs to the post-processing engine. A typical Rule File contains statements and actions, often expressed in a simple symbolic syntax. For instance:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The symbol ``\texttt{|}'' can be used to comment out lines.
    \item The symbol ``\texttt{*}'' indicates an \emph{AND} operation.
    \item The symbol ``\texttt{+}'' indicates an \emph{OR} operation.
\end{itemize}
The \acrshort{jscutin} file is a \acrshort{json}-based file containing \acrshort{saphsolve} engine quantification results and \acrlong{be} information. As discussed previously, users may wish to update existing quantification results without re-quantifying the entire \acrshort{pra} model. To do so, a rule file is created to specify updates to the \acrshort{mcs}. The post-processing engine parses both the \acrshort{jscutin} file and the rule file, executes the specified actions, modifies the \acrshort{mcs} list accordingly, recalculates the \acrshort{mcs} probability using the \acrshort{mcub} approach, and ultimately outputs a new \acrshort{jscutin} file.

The post-processing engine is implemented in C\#. The \acrshort{jscutin} file or rule file can be directly supplied to the engine, or the engine can retrieve input files from a database if required. Converting the rule file into a \acrshort{json} format improves portability and offers efficient communication channels with other engines or databases. During this conversion, the original rule file contents are transformed into two lists: the \emph{condition list} and the \emph{action list}. In a typical rule file, users define conditional statements that specify actions to be taken for basic events within the generated \acrshort{mcs}. The action list encompasses potential adjustments or filtering steps, retaining all desired possibilities in \acrshort{json} objects.

\paragraph{Masked Basic Event Number Allocation}

The rule file contains assigned basic event names, whereas the \acrshort{jscutin} file includes \acrshort{mcs} that are masked. The post-processing engine can \emph{unmask} the \acrshort{mcs} information during processing and then \emph{re-mask} it when generating the updated \acrshort{jscutin} file. This masking technique enables faster manipulation of large data sets.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Bits 0--17:} Event number
    \item \textbf{Bits 18--24:} Phase information
    \item \textbf{Bits 25--29:} Model type
    \item \textbf{Bit 30:} Basic event tag
    \item \textbf{Bit 31:} Complement information
\end{itemize}

\noindent Figure~\ref{fig:bit-dist-masked} shows how these 32 bits are allocated in the masked identifier. As a simple example, consider an event, encoded as the integer value \(\displaystyle 33816579\). When parsed, this corresponds to: \[
\text{Event ID} = 3, \quad
\text{Phase} = 1, \quad
\text{Model Type} = 1.
\]

\subsection{Illustrative Example: Post-Processing Workflow}
\label{sec:postproc-example}

To demonstrate the practical application of the SAPHSOLVE post-processing engine, an example based on the ACC fault tree (FT) model from the generic PWR benchmark has been presented here. This example shows all the above mentioned steps, from initial cut set generation to rule-based post-processing and result validation.

\paragraph{Initial Model and Cut Sets}

The initial \acrshort{jscutin} file for the ACC FT model encodes 78 minimal cut sets, each represented as a list of masked event identifiers. For example, a portion of the \texttt{cutsetlist} is as follows:

\begin{minted}[firstnumber=31,frame=single]{json}
"cutsetlist": [
  { "event": [33816688, 33816689, 33816690] },
  { "event": [33816688, 33816689, 33816691] },
  { "event": [33816689, 33816690, 33816691] },
  ...
]
\end{minted}

The total probability of all cut sets is $6.10696 \times 10^{-2}$. Each event identifier is a 32-bit integer encoding event, phase, and model type information, as described in the masked event number allocation section.

\paragraph{Rule File Specification}

A user-defined Rule File is designed to remove cut sets containing specific combinations of LOCA-related events. The rule syntax supports logical operations (AND, OR, NOT) and actions such as \texttt{DeleteRoot} (removal of a cut set). For example, the following rule removes cut sets containing any pairwise combination of LOCA events, unless the sequence is initiated by a LOCA initiating event:

\begin{minted}[frame=single]{python}
if ((~IE-LLOCA + ~IE-MLOCA + ~IE-SLOCA) *
    (RCS-LOCA-CL1 * RCS-LOCA-CL2 +
     RCS-LOCA-CL1 * RCS-LOCA-CL3 +
     RCS-LOCA-CL1 * RCS-LOCA-CL4 +
     RCS-LOCA-CL2 * RCS-LOCA-CL3 +
     RCS-LOCA-CL2 * RCS-LOCA-CL4 +
     RCS-LOCA-CL3 * RCS-LOCA-CL4)) then
  DeleteRoot;
endif
\end{minted}

\paragraph{Rule File Representations}

The post-processing engine is capable of parsing rule files in multiple representations, as shown in Table~\ref{tab:rule-file-representations} including:

\input{task_III/saphsolve/tables/rule_file_representations}

\paragraph{Rule File Parsing and JSON Conversion}

Upon ingestion, the Rule File is parsed and converted into a structured JSON format, as defined by the schema. For example, a parsed rule in JSON form appears as:

\begin{minted}[firstnumber=1,frame=single]{json}
{
  "generalpostprocessingrules": {
    "conditionList": [
      {
        "rulesection": 1,
        "conditionid": 2,
        "conditiontype": "IF",
        "condition": [
          { "event": ["~IE-LLOCA"] },
          { "event": ["~IE-MLOCA"] },
          { "event": ["~IE-SLOCA"] },
          { "event": ["RCS-LOCA-CL1 andOpr RCS-LOCA-CL2"] },
          ...
        ],
        "actionlist": [
          "DeleteRoot;"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
\end{minted}

\paragraph{Post-Processing Execution and Results}

The post-processing engine applies the parsed rules to the input \acrshort{jscutin} file. For the ACC FT model, the rule targeting LOCA event combinations results in the removal of all cut sets containing such events, except for those consistent with the initiating event logic. The output is a post-processed \acrshort{jscutin} file containing only 2 cut sets, for example:
\begin{minted}[firstnumber=30,frame=single]{json}
"cutsetlist": [
  { "event": [33819496] },
  { "event": [33820000] }
]
\end{minted}
The recalculated total probability is $2.428 \times 10^{-7}$, demonstrating a substantial reduction in both the number of cut sets and the aggregate risk metric, directly attributable to the rule-based filtering.

\paragraph{Conclusion.} The SAPHSOLVE post-processing engine provides an efficient mechanism for analysts to manipulate PRA cut sets according to their analysis needs, without the computational burden of full model re-quantification. The example above illustrates the practical benefits and technical accuracy of the approach.
