\section{SCRAM Optimizations}

Optimizations were made in the following areas:

1. Optimizing data structure use:
 1.1 Migrated the ZBDD container holding the minimal cut sets from a custom, pointer-based representation, to STL containers.
 1.2 Migrated containers hold processed minimal cut sets to STL containers. Previous profiling had indicated that the solver time is dominated by postprocessing logic (reporter).
 
2. Exploiting parallelism using OpenMP:
 2.1 probability calculation MCUB and REA approximations.
 2.2 importance analysis.
 2.3 uncertainty quantification.



Limitations and Future Work:
1. BDD data-structure remains custom. BDD probability calculation remains serial. Multicore BDD, and GPU BDD solvers can be used.
