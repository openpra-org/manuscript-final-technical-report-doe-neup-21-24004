\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Motivation}
The development and use of PRAs in the nuclear industry have revolutionized our approach to design, reliability, and safety. Since the release of WASH-1400 in 1975 and NUREG-1150 in 1990, the PRA applications have diversified and become more computationally demanding, nevertheless the tools that we use to perform such assessments have not kept up with the technological advancements in
high-performance computing and computer science applications. Now, although there is a need for supporting real-time decisions at the nuclear plants using PRAs, this is not practical using the computationally strained legacy PRA tools currently available since they were developed and are maintained using technologies that are nowadays deprecated. The legacy PRA tools, although still perform well on internal events PRA models that have reasonable sizes, suffer greatly, both in terms of speed and memory requirements, when challenged by more sophisticated models such as single hazard
PRAs, and especially multi-hazard PRAs. Therefore, a major redesign of the PRA tools is necessary starting from the computational engine capabilities, backend services to handle large PRA models, and a
user-friendly PRA frontend that can automatically generate results and documentation necessary to inform non-PRA experts.

\section{Objectives}
The main objective of this work is to develop, demonstrate, and evaluate a probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) software platform needed to address the major challenges of the current legacy PRA
tools, such as better quantification speed, integration of multi-hazard models into traditional PRAs, and model modification simplification and documentation automation. To achieve the main objective, we will first perform benchmarking and profiling of current PRA tools, such as SCRAM [1] and US NRCâ€™s SAPHIRE [2, Vol. 1] , to investigate the current bottlenecks in the quantification speed and memory requirements. Secondly, we will design, implement, and benchmark a PRA software platform based on a web-based stack using the latest technologies available to overcome the mentioned challenges. Finally, we will evaluate the performance gains of this framework by modeling and quantifying large PRA models that would have been too expensive to run using the legacy PRA tools.
