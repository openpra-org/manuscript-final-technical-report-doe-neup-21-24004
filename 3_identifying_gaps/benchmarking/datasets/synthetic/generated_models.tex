\subsection{Summary of Generated Synthetic Datasets}
\label{sec:synthetic-datasets-summary}

A total of thirteen distinct synthetic model datasets were generated using the methodology described above. Each dataset is characterized by its structural configuration, parameter ranges, and output formats. The datasets are designed to cover a broad spectrum of model sizes and complexities. All models are deep fault trees, with variations in the number of gates, basic events, and gate type distributions.

The \texttt{100\_to\_100k\_voter} dataset consists of models with 100, 1,000, 10,000, and 100,000 basic events, with gate weights configured either for all gate types or for K/N gates only, and a fixed percentage of common basic events. The \texttt{1\_to\_4k} dataset contains models with the number of gates ranging from 1 to 4,000, alternating between OR and AND gates. The \texttt{1\_to\_50k} and \texttt{1\_to\_5k} datasets similarly vary the number of gates from 1 up to 50,000 and 5,000, respectively, with alternating gate types and are provided in multiple formats. The \texttt{2\_to\_100k} dataset includes models with basic events ranging from 2 to 100,000, with AND and OR gate types and varying percentages of common basic events. The \texttt{500\_to\_750} dataset features models with 500, 550, 600, and 750 basic events, with specific gate weights, common event percentages, and, in some cases, common-cause failure groups.

The remaining datasets, labeled \texttt{c1-P\_0.01-0.05} through \texttt{c7-P\_0.35-0.9}, are parameter sweeps where the number of basic events ranges from 100 to 5,000, and the maximum and minimum probabilities for basic events are systematically varied. These datasets are provided in OpenPSA and, where applicable, SAPHSOLVE JSInp formats.

Table~\ref{tab:syn_datasets_overview} provides an overview of the generated datasets, including their naming conventions, key parameter ranges, and supported formats. All datasets are publicly available and are structured to facilitate reproducibility and direct comparison across PRA quantification engines.
