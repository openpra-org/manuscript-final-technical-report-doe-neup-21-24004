\subsection{The Generic Pressurized Water Reactor Model}
\label{subsec:generic_pwr_dataset}

Since 1995, \acrshort{inl} has developed \acrfull{spar} models for the \acrshort{us} \acrshort{nrc} to provide critical risk-informed input to the regulatory process. The generic \acrshort{pwr} model is available as a SAPHIRE model, accompanied by a report detailing the foundations of the modeling phenomena and referencing failure data. The current version of the SAPHIRE model is v1.2; however, the documented model information corresponds to v1.0 \cite{aras_generic_2024}. This model is continuously evolving, with researchers and PRA practitioners actively working to improve it.

At present, the model considers various initiating events, including seismic activity, internal flooding, internal fires, hurricanes, high winds,  large break \acrfull{loca}, ISLOCA (Interfacing Systems \acrshort{loca}), upset conditions leading to transients, loss of \acrfull{ccw}, loss of DC bus, loss of feedwater, loss of offsite power, large steam line breaks, medium break \acrshort{loca}, steam generator tube ruptures, small \acrshort{loca}, tornadoes, and excessive \acrshort{loca}. Version 1.0 of the model includes 56 event trees linked with 140 fault trees. Summary statistics and SAPHIRE quantification results for the Generic \acrshort{pwr} v1.0 model are provided in Table~\ref{tab:generic_pwr_summary}.
