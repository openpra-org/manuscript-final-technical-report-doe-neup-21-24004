The benchmarking study focuses on four widely used PRA quantification engines: SAPHSOLVE, FTREX, XFTA, and SCRAM. Each tool implements distinct algorithms for minimal cut set (MCS) generation and probability quantification, and each supports different input model formats. In addition to these, the \acrshort{hcla} binary was available for this study, but was not included in the benchmarking runs. Table~\ref{tab:binary_checksums} summarizes the key characteristics and binary details of the tools available for this benchmark.
