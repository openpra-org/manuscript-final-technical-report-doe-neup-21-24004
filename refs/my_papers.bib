            The development of the nuclear industry’s Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) has significantly contributed to the design, reliability, and safety of nuclear power plants (NPP). Today, PRAs form integration in all nuclear power plant development stages, including design, licensing, operation, maintenance, and decommissioning. Many legacy PRA tools have been used in the nuclear field; however, more powerful tools are needed to cope with the rapid development of the nuclear industry and NPP designs. These tools are now required to analyze new aspects of the plants that were never envisioned before, and more computational resources are needed.
            This study uses synthetically generated fault trees of various sizes and specifications to benchmark fault tree solvers; XFTA version 1.3.1 and SCRAM version 0.16.2. The analysis is performed in two steps. The first step is to compare the probabilities, minimal cut sets, and importance factors. The second step is measuring CPU time, wall time, and the memory usage of each engine for benchmarking. The result for the first step for the same configuration is the same for each calculation engine. Overall, XFTA can complete most of the given runs in a shorter time with less memory usage than SCRAM. All computations and measurements are done on a specified computer.},

Traditional modeling techniques, such as fault trees (FT) and event trees (ET), are fundamental in analyzing system failures, accident progression, and quantifying release frequencies. However, the complexity and intricate dependencies among system components of nuclear power plants make it challenging for students and junior risk analysts to identify all potential failure modes, resulting in an exceedingly cumbersome modeling process due to their limited expertise and knowledge. This knowledge gap often leads to incomplete models or inadvertent errors, compromising the accuracy and comprehensiveness of PRA models.},

            Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) tools are crucial in the nuclear, aerospace, maritime, and chemical industries. This paper presents OpenPRA, an innovative, open-source, web-based platform designed to address the limitations of current Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) tools. OpenPRA offers a collaborative and flexible environment that supports a wide array of risk models and quantification engines, thereby enhancing the adaptability and efficiency of risk assessment processes. The platform offers unique features including support for various risk models such as event trees, fault trees, Markov chains, Bayesian networks, and error propagation models. It also allows users to choose from a variety of existing quantification engines, enabling them to tailor their risk assessment process to their specific needs. The paper discusses the design, development, and potential of OpenPRA to transform the field of PRA. It also delves into the platform’s technical architecture, technology stack, and the OpenPRA Model Exchange Format. The paper concludes by outlining the current development status of OpenPRA and laying out the foundation for future work.},
