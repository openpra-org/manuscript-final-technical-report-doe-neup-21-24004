	abstract = {SAPHIRE has been extensively employed for over 35 years to model risk-important systems and quantify risk models. As a well-established and thoroughly documented Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) tool, SAPHIRE has continuously tracked computational trends and received regular updates. Despite its ongoing evolution, there remains a need for further enhancements, particularly in dealing with the quantification of exceptionally large models. These improvements could take the form of algorithmic advancements, harnessing the power of parallel computing, and exploring the potential benefits of cloud computing solutions. Considering these aspirations, the notion of a remote solve option was introduced and subsequently evolved into a dedicated project within the SAPHIRE development team. A significant outcome of this initiative is SAPHSOLVE, an engine extracted from the SageRisk API designed specifically for remote solving capabilities. The ongoing project is nearing its culmination, marked by a series of discoveries that have brought undocumented aspects to light. Among these revelations is the intricacy of the input and output format for the SAPHSOLVE engine. This document serves the crucial purpose of meticulously delineating the precise formats for both input and output, as they form an indispensable foundation. The importance of documenting these formats cannot be overstated, as it is a pivotal step in facilitating rigorous testing and comparison. Whether it involves scrutinizing SAPHSOLVE results against those of the internal integrated solver or other external solvers, the ability to construct models or transform existing ones into a compatible SAPHSOLVE format is imperative. Chapter 1 offers a succinct introduction to both SAPHIRE and SAPHSOLVE, followed by Chapter 2 which outlines the roadmap for enhancing SAPHSOLVE. The core of this report is Chapter 3, which intricately elucidates the intricacies of the input and output file formats. To provide a tangible illustration of these formats, a rudimentary example has been compiled and is available in Appendix. SAPHSOLVE represents a novel external solving mechanism developed by the SAPHIRE team, although it has not yet reached the full spectrum of capabilities possessed by SAPHIRE's internal solver. However, the SAPHIRE team has set a comprehensive course for incorporating the functionalities of SAPHSOLVE. A comprehensive outlook on the future of SAPHSOLVE is expounded upon in Chapter 4.},
